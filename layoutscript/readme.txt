put the layout files from mame in a folder inside here called layout
this will generate text files and .bin files that are compatible with the taito space invaders color proms

might be some bugs in here.. And mame likes to pick colors that weren't in the original prom - since the plastic overlays didn't have to be compatible. As they were just plastic.
